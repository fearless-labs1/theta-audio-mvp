# Agent Instructions

- Keep environment provisioning guidance in this repository. Prefer updating `scripts/setup_flutter_android.sh` for Flutter/Android toolchain setup rather than scattering one-off commands.
- Document setup steps for contributors in `README.md` or within `scripts/` comments when changing tooling.
- Avoid checking large binaries or installer archives into the repository; rely on scripted downloads instead.
