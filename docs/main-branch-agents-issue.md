# Issue: Add AGENTS.md to `main` branch

## Summary
Create or update an `AGENTS.md` on the `main` branch (release/website branch) so contributor guidance matches or is stricter than the development branch.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `AGENTS.md` exists on `main` with the same or tighter instructions on architecture, tooling, and testing expectations.
- Guidance includes Flutter analyze/build_runner/test requirements and Material 3/clean architecture expectations.
- Documentation and setup notes remain consistent with repository practices (no large binaries; centralized setup scripts).
