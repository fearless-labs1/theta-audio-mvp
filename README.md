We humbly present “Theta”, 

a new Christian prayer and meditation app developed by Fearless Labs, completely free to download and free forever for everyone. (Download link for free Theta Windows & Android apps provided below.) 

There’s a saying: If something you need doesn’t exist, create it. 

Recently, I found deep confidence and security by staying in continual prayer and gratitude throughout the day—remaining grounded in the Lord and protected from the pressures of modern life. 

For months, my phone would ping with dozens of prayer alarms, reminding me not to drift into the flesh or fall for the enemy’s distractions. 

This birthed my desire to build Theta. 

If no one else needed it, I did—so that my bedroom could be filled with hundreds of spoken prayers daily, keeping my spirit aligned, and so that when I left home, those same prayers and affirmations could play through my car radio or discreetly through my wireless earpiece, even with my phone locked away in my pocket—keeping me in a constant state of Theta.

“Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” — Do God’s work first; then, through prayer and petition, present your requests to Him.

What is the Theta app? 

The Theta app is designed to continuously read prayers aloud through your speakers or earpiece, throughout your home, your children’s bedrooms, your office, or any environment you choose, using the Windows or Mac desktop app. Playback continues even when your computer enters full black-screen hibernation mode. In other words, the prayers will keep playing indefinitely until you choose to press “Stop Theta.” 

Beyond the home: 

When you’re out in the field, at the shops, in town, or simply away from home, Theta allows those same prayers to play at set intervals through your earpiece, phone speaker, or car speakers—helping you remain in a “Theta state” of constant prayer, gratitude, and appreciation throughout the day - (through Theta iOS & Android apps - coming soon) 

Along with Theta "Prayer State" we built "Guide Me" 

Guide Me is your 24/7 AI spiritual companion that provides biblically-grounded, compassionate guidance powered by the world’s most advanced AI - like having a wise Christian counselor available instantly whenever you need spiritual wisdom." 

This is Theta's SECRET WEAPON - transforming it from "just another prayer app" into a comprehensive spiritual growth platform Not a generic AI. 

Not a search engine. 

Guide Me is purpose-built to give you instantly available, biblically-grounded wisdom. 

What makes Theta "Guide Me" unique:

• Scripture-rooted answers, not secular advice 
• Compassionate, pastoral tone 
• Deep, detailed guidance (up to 1,500 words) 
• Instant responses in 5–10 seconds 
• Completely private — nothing stored or tracked 
• Designed specifically as a Christian spiritual counselor 

Why it’s powerful: 

Guide Me understands context, emotion, and complex spiritual questions, giving you theologically-sound guidance any time — day or night. It helps you process struggles, find clarity, and pray through real-life issues, all grounded in God’s Word. 

Together with Theta’s automated prayers, prayer + AI guidance becomes a complete spiritual support system. 

A wise, Scripture-anchored companion — available whenever you need spiritual insight. Guide Me is a purpose-built Christian spiritual guide — trained, configured, and designed to give you instantly available, Scripture-rooted wisdom whenever you need it. 

What makes Theta "Guide Me" different? 

Biblically grounded: Every answer is shaped through a Christian worldview — not generic advice, not secular psychology. It references Scripture, explains context, and applies biblical truth to your specific situation. 

Instant, 24/7 availability: 

You get compassionate, thoughtful spiritual guidance in 5–10 seconds. No appointments. No waiting. No judgment. 

Deep, detailed answers: 

Guide Me can deliver up to 1,500 words of nuanced, theologically-sound insight — far deeper than what a normal LLM would ever give by default. 

Pastoral tone: 

It responds with humility, clarity, compassion, and faith-focus. It meets you where you are spiritually — helping you grow, not condemning you. 

Private & secure: 

Your conversations aren’t stored, tracked, or sold. Your API key is protected and all communication is encrypted. 

Why it’s more powerful than a standard AI model or search engine:

Most AI tools are general-purpose and offer secular, mixed-worldview advice. Guide Me is specifically configured as a Christian spiritual counselor — 

giving you: 

Theologically sound explanations Prayer-focused responses Scripture-led answers Context-aware spiritual insight Practical wisdom tied to biblical truth This isn’t copying articles. 

This isn’t summarizing websites. It’s personalized, biblically-anchored guidance built for believers. 

It actually understands MY situation. 
The depth of the answer feels like talking to a wise pastor. 
It’s the first AI that feels truly Christian. 
Having prayers AND guidance in one app is incredible. 

The power behind Guide Me Built on OpenAI’s flagship model — Guide Me understands context, emotion, Scripture, and complex spiritual questions with clarity. 

It integrates perfectly with Theta’s automated prayers, giving you: PRAYER + GUIDANCE → a complete spiritual support system. 

Your day is covered by constant prayer rhythms, and your heart is covered by on-demand biblical wisdom. 

In one sentence: Guide Me is your always-available, Scripture-driven AI companion—offering deep, compassionate Christian guidance powered by the world’s most advanced AI, whenever you need spiritual wisdom. 

Today, I am honoured to share Theta with you.
